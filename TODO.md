TODO (maybe)
* ?import resources from zip https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/zipimport.html
* do not force show window after if splashscreen exists
* redirect `stdout` to a widget
* cache ui files
* Why `QtCore.QMetaObject.connectSlotsByName` connects signals twice? https://wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt/AutoConnectingSlots
* FIXME: QListView.currentChanged slot is treated as an event
